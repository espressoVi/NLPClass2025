Anh read a book. On the first day she read $n$ pages in $t$ minutes, where $n$ and $t$ are positive integers. On the second day Anh read $n + 1$ pages in $t + 1$ minutes. Each day thereafter Anh read one more page than she read on the previous day, and it took her one more minute than on the previous day until she completely read the $374$ page book. It took her a total of $319$ minutes to read the book. Find $n + t$ .

Let's think step-by-step.
 - Let $d$ be the number of days.,
 - Pages read form an arithmetic sequence: $n, (n+1), \\dots, (n+d-1)$.,
 - Minutes form an arithmetic sequence: $t, (t+1), \\dots, (t+d-1)$.,
 - Minutes form an arithmetic sequence: $t, (t+1), \\dots, (t+d-1)$.,
 - Sum of minutes: $dt+\\dfrac{d(d-1)}{2}=319$.,
 - Subtract sums: $d(n-t) = 374-319 = 55$.,
 - Hence $d$ divides $55$, so $d \\in {1, 5, 11, 55}$.,
 - $d \\ge 2$ (a second day is described), so test $d = 5, 11, 55$.,
 - Let $S=\\dfrac{d(d-1)}{2}$. For $d = 5$, $S = 10$ gives $n = \\dfrac{374-10}{5} = 72.8$ (not integer).,
 - For $d=11$, $S=55$ gives $n=\\dfrac{374-55}{11}=29$, $t=\\dfrac{319-55}{11}=24$, both integers.,
 - For $d=55$, $S = 1485 > 374 \\rightarrow$ n<0$ (invalid).,
 - Thus $d=11, n = 29, t=24$ satisfy all conditions.,
 - Compute $n+t=29+24=53$.

Let's think step-by-step.
 - Write every logarithm in base $2$: $\\log_8 x=\\dfrac{\\log_2 x}{3}$ and $\\log_4 x=\\dfrac{\\log_2 x}{2}$.,
 - Set $A=\\log_2 a$ and $B=\\log_2 b$.,
 - Convert the first equation: $\\dfrac{A}{3}+B=5$.,
 - Convert the second equation: $\\dfrac{B}{3}+A=7$.,
 - Multiply the first by $3$: $A+3B=15$.,
 - Multiply the second by $3$: $3A+B=21$.,
 - Solve the system: subtract to get $8B=24$, so $B=3$.,
 - Substitute $B=3$ into $A+3B=15$ to find $A=6$.,
 - Recover $a$ and $b$: $a=2^{A}=2^{6}=64$ and $b=2^{B}=2^{3}=8$.,
 - Compute the product: $ab=64\\times 8=512$.

For positive integer $n$ , let $s(n)$ denote the sum of the digits of $n$ .  Find the smallest positive integer satisfying $s(n) = s(n+864) = 20$ .

Let's think step-by-step.
 - Let $n = 100 \\times d_2 + 10 \\times d_1 + d_0$ be the $3$ digit number.,
 - $\\Rightarrow n + 864 = 100 \\times (d_2 + 8) + 10 \\times (d_1 + 6) + (d_0 + 4)$.,
 - When a constant $c$ is added to $n$, we have $s(n+c)=s(n)+s(c)-9C$, where $C$ is the number of carries produced in the addition (each carry lowers the digit-sum by $9$).,
 - Here $c=864$ and $s(864)=8+6+4=18$.,
 - We need $20=s(n+864)=20+18-9C \\Longrightarrow 18-9C=0 \\Longrightarrow C=2$, i.e., exactly $2$ carries in $864+n$.,
 - $n$ can't be $2$ digit, as $s(n) \\leq 18$,
 - Additionally, $d_2 + d_1 + d_0 = 20$, and we want to minimize $n$.,
 - $d_1 + d_0 \\leq 18 \\Rightarrow d_2 \\geq 2$, so we have the first carry.,
 - To make the number as small as possible we should minimize $d_2, d_1, d_0$, in that order.,
 - But, $d_2 = 2 \\rightarrow C = 3$, $d_2 = 3 \\rightarrow C = 3$, $d_2 = 4 \\rightarrow C = 3$, $d_2 = 5 \\rightarrow C = 3$,
 - Thus, minimum $d_2 \\geq 6$,
 - $d_2 = 6 \\Rightarrow d_1 + d_0 = 14$,
 - $d_1 \\geq 5$ for minimum valid number, which gives another carry.,
 - So, $d_0 \\leq 5$, but we should maximize the last digit to minimize the number.,
 - Therefore, $d_0 = 5, d_2 = 6 \\Rightarrow d_1 = 9$.,
 - We have $n = 695$, let's verify $695 + 864 = 1559$.,
 - $s(1559) = s(695) = 20$, so this is the answer.

Answer: \boxed{20}
